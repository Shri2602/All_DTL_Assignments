\section{ Using Section and Subsection}
\vspace{5mm}
\subsection{Chapter 1 : Abstract Machines}
One of the most general concepts employing abstraction is the \textit{\textbf{abstract machine}} .
\paragraph{In this chapter, we will see how this concept is closely related to the programming languages.} We will also see how, without requiring us to go into the specific details of any particular implementation, it allows us to describe what an implementation
of a programming language is. To do this, we will describe in general terms what
is meant by the interpreter and the compiler for a language. Finally, will see how
abstract machines can be structured in hierarchies that describe and implement complex software systems.
\subsubsection{ Concepts of Abstract Machine and of Interpreter}
\subparagraph{ the context of this book, the term \textit{“machine”} refers clearly to a computing machine. As we know, an electronic, digital computer is a physical machine that executes algorithms which are suitably formalised so that the machine can \textit{“understand”} them. Intuitively, an abstract machine is nothing more than an abstraction of the concept of a physical computer.}
\subsubsection{The Interpreter}
Clearly the interpreter must perform the operations that are specific to the language it is interpreting, L . However, even given the diversity of languages, it is possible to discern types of operation and an \textit{“execution method”} common to all interpreters.
\subsubsection{An Example of an Abstract Machine: The Hardware Machine}
From what has been said so far, it should be clear that the concept of abstract machine can be used to describe a variety of different systems, ranging from physical machines right up to the World Wide Web.\\
As a first example of an abstract machine, let us consider the concrete case of a
conventional physical machine such as that in Fig. 1.3. It is physically implemented using logic circuits and electronic components. Let us call such a machine MHL H and let L H be its machine language.
\subsection{Chapter 2 : How to Describe a Programming Language}
A programming language is an artificial formalism in which algorithms can be expressed. For all its artificiality, though, this formalism remains a language. Its study can make good use of the many concepts and tools developed in the last century in linguistics (which studies both natural and artificial languages). Without going into great detail, this chapter poses the problem of what it means to “give” (define or understand) a programming language and which tools can be used in this undertaking
\subsubsection{Levels of Description}
In a study which has now become a classic in linguistics, Morris [6] studied the
various levels at which a description of a language can occur. He identified three
major areas: grammar, semantics and pragmatics.
Grammar is that part of the description of the language which answers the question: which phrases are correct? Once the alphabet of a language has been defined as a first step (in the case of natural language, for example, the Latin alphabet of 22 or 26 letters, the Cyrillic alphabet, etc.), the lexical component, which uses this alphabet, identifies the sequence of symbols constituting the words (or tokens) of the language defined. 
\subsubsection{Grammar and Syntax}
We have already said that the grammar of a language first establishes the alphabet
and lexicon. Then by means of a syntax, it defines those sequences of symbols corresponding to well-formed phrases and sentences (or to “sentences” in short). Clearly, at least from the viewpoint of natural language, the definition of the (finite) alphabet is immediate.
